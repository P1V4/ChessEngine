# Chess AI
This is our work on AIFA Topic Representation.
We planned to make a Chess AI. 
Before we can start that, we need to first make the game itself.
All the code required for the game are written in UI.py and all the AI code is written in AI.py.
SpriteExtractor.py is just a utility program to extract sprites from a sprite sheet.

This project has only begun and is in developement stage.
